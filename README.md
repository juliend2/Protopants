# Protopants

Prototype-based programming for the PHP fancy pants.

## Affordances

- Monkey patching of an object's _Prototype_ methods
- Dynamic modification of any _object_ during runtime

## TODO

- [x] Invert first 2 params of Prototype::extend()
- [ ] Implement mixins/multiple inheritance
- [ ] Implement method overloading, maybe by using several with... named arguments like smalltalk does
- [ ] Maybe add a way to call methods on non-object values, such as integers.
  Through a function.
